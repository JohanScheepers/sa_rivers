I’m excited to introduce SA Rivers, an app designed to bridge the gap between critical data and the people who need it most.

Whether it's for flood safety or general water management, knowing what our rivers are doing in real-time is vital. We’ve built a solution that puts this power directly into your hands. 📱

SA Rivers connects: ✅ The Public: Stay safe and informed about rising water levels. ✅ Emergency Services: Receive early warnings to respond faster to flood risks. ✅ Government: Access accurate data for better infrastructure planning.

From disaster prevention to daily awareness, we are monitoring South Africa's rivers for everyone.
